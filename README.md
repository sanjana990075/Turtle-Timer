# Turtle-Timer
Turtle Timer is a simple graphical countdown timer built using Pythonâ€™s turtle module. It allows users to input hours, minutes, and seconds and visually displays the countdown in a digital clock format. The timer is enclosed within a drawn rectangle, and once the countdown reaches zero, an alert message appears on the screen.
